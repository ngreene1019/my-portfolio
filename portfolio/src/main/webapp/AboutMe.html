      <h1>A little about me...</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a rising Junior at Howard University 
          studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about 
          computer science + education with aspirations of 
          being a computer science teacher one day üçé. 
          This past school year I spent time volunterring
          for the Microsoft Code Academy. I had the 
          oppurtunity to teach Secondary level Black 
          students basic computer programing principles,
          HTML, and CSS sills alongside Microsoft employeesüíª.
          If I'm not in front of a Computer screen, you'll 
          probably find me reading, baking, or litsening
          to music.
